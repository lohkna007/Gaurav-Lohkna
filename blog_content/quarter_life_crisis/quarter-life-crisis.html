            <h2>The Quarter-Life Crisis</h2>
            <p><strong>Published on November 16, 2024</strong></p>

            <p>
                You've heard much about the mid-life crisis and how it affects individuals, but there's a newer concept with a different nuance: the quarter-life crisis. I first used this phrase when describing the ongoing challenges in my life to a friend.
            </p>

            <h3>Understanding the Mid-Life Crisis</h3>
            <p>
                But let's take a moment to understand the mid-life crisis before moving on to the quarter-life crisis. According to me, a mid-life crisis happens when someone has more or less achieved certain things (think of Maslow's hierarchy of needs), usually involving the basics necessary for day-to-day life—food, clothing, and shelter (or as we say in Hindi, <em>roti, kapda, makaan</em>).
            </p>
            <p>
                Nowadays, the internet feels like a basic necessity too.
            </p>

            <h3>Quarter-Life Crisis: A Different Challenge</h3>
            <p>
                In my opinion, what once took a decade to achieve can now be reached in just 3-4 years (at least for those of us going through a quarter-life crisis). We have securities, earn sustainable salaries, and yet feel empty when it comes to fulfilling our personal dreams.
            </p>

            <p>
                Maybe, until now, we’ve been fulfilling the wishes others had for us. Now, we’re at a stage where options abound—each seeming achievable. We want to explore paths and experiences but also have responsibilities—family, loved ones, and people we care about.
            </p>

            <h3>The Questions We Face</h3>
            <p>
                This phase of life, I call the quarter-life crisis. Maybe I’m too young to experience all this, or maybe I just want too much. But having a variety of dreams is what makes us human.
            </p>

            <p>
                Some dreams come true, others fade away with time. You can’t have the best of all worlds—every dream comes with gains and losses. Your desires keep you alive, your needs keep you grounded, and your sense of self-actualization is a journey.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>How will you decide your life?</strong>
