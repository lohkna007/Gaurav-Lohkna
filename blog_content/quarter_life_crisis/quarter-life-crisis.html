                <p class="lead">You've heard much about the mid-life crisis and how it affects individuals, but there's
                    a newer concept with a different nuance: the quarter-life crisis. I first used this phrase when
                    describing the ongoing challenges in my life to a friend.</p>

                <p>But let's take a moment to understand the mid-life crisis before moving on to the quarter-life
                    crisis. According to me, a mid-life crisis happens when someone has more or less achieved certain
                    things (think of Maslow's hierarchy of needs), usually involving the basics necessary for day-to-day
                    life. Food, clothing, and shelter (or as we say in Hindi, <em>roti, kapda, makaan</em>). Nowadays,
                    the internet feels like a basic necessity too.</p>

                <p>As long as I can remember, or at least from observing those around me while growing up, people used
                    to take about 12-15 years on average to achieve these basics and some sort of financial security
                    such as savings, investments, assets, and collaterals for rainy days or special occasions like
                    weddings.</p>

                <p>So, people generally spent about 12-15 years (starting from around age 21-23) working to secure these
                    needs and build a stable life. Now imagine a time when you’ve met your basic needs and established
                    some sense of safety and security. What's your next challenge? Is it to become more secure? Yes, but
                    that’s an ongoing process, and it will never feel like enough. So, what's next?</p>

                <figure style="text-align:center; margin: 3rem 0;">
                    <img src="quarter-life-crisis-thumbnail.jpg" alt="Illustration for Quarter-Life Crisis"
                        class="blog-image">
                    <figcaption class="muted" style="font-style:italic; font-size:0.9rem">Navigating the maze of choices
                        in your 20s.</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>This is where the mid-life crisis enters. You’ve spent your youth working to achieve these basics,
                    and now, with some security, you're faced with a different struggle. You want to climb higher, to
                    earn more, to save more, etc. And that pursuit never ends. But in the back of your mind, you long
                    for the things you put off to get here. You want to study again, take the trip you missed during
                    those stressful workdays, or finally buy that SUV.</p>

                <p>You now have just enough to survive and just enough to dream. This is the dilemma. You dream of
                    studying abroad, but double-guess whether it still makes sense. It feels like a risky bet with much
                    to lose, but you can’t shake the thought.</p>

                <p>In my opinion, what once took a decade to achieve can now be reached in just 3-4 years (at least for
                    those of us going through a quarter-life crisis). We have some securities, we earn sustainable,
                    lucrative salaries (putting us in the top 10% of earners in India), and yet...we feel empty when it
                    comes to fulfilling our personal dreams.</p>

                <p>Maybe, until now, we’ve been fulfilling the wishes and dreams others had for us, becoming what others
                    expected. Now, we're at a stage in life where options abound: each one seeming achievable. We want
                    to do everything, explore different paths and experiences. But we also have responsibilities of
                    family, loved ones, and the people we prioritize because they give us that sense of love and
                    belonging.</p>

                <p>You're constantly juggling these demands: physiological needs, love and belonging. You work one third
                    of your day, spend time with family, your partner, and friends. But somewhere along the way, you
                    place yourself, your self-actualization, at the very end of the list.</p>

                <p>You hear it every day: "Prioritize yourself, prioritize your dreams," from success gurus and the
                    like. But is it even feasible? I don’t think so. It’s hard, and perhaps it’s part of the natural
                    process. We move from basic needs to love and belonging, and then later, self-actualization. It’s
                    only once we’ve met our more immediate needs that we begin to contemplate our dreams, because now,
                    maybe for the first time, we can afford them, whether it’s with money or time.</p>

                <p>This is the stage where you start wondering: Should I chase after the things I truly want? Or should
                    I keep doing what I’ve been doing, which is allowing me the luxury of contemplating these dreams?
                    These are tough choices. Sometimes they're life changing, sometimes not. They can lead to a
                    fulfilling life with no regrets, or to misery with thoughts of missed opportunities and unfulfilled
                    dreams.</p>

                <p>What do I do now? What do I want from life? How can I achieve all these things? You start your day
                    with these questions and end it the same way.</p>

                <p>This phase of life, I call the quarter-life crisis. Maybe I’m too young to experience all this, or
                    maybe I just want too much. But I think having a variety of dreams and desires is what makes us
                    human. Some dreams come true, while others fade away with time. And that, I suppose, is life. You
                    can’t have the best of all worlds—every dream comes with good and bad, not just in the outcome, but
                    in what you gain or lose along the way.</p>

                <p>Your desires keep you alive, your basic needs keep you grounded, and your sense of self-actualization
                    is the journey, not the end goal.</p>

                <p>Maybe, down the line, you’ll realize that many of the things you once wished for were driven by ego,
                    jealousy, or societal validation, not by the dreams that would bring you true, sustainable
                    happiness. It’s important to find the dreams that actually make you happy—and more importantly, ones
                    that can be sustained.</p>

                <p>Self-actualization is a journey, filled with experiences that can’t be rushed or bypassed. So, how
                    will you decide your life?</p>
